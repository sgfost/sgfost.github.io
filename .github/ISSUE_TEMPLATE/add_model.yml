        Use this issue for:
        - tracking progress in the making FAIR process
        - collaborating and dividing tasks
        - documenting each step of the process (i.e., when each of the FAIR criteria are met, or any issues you have found in achieving the criteria)
        
        _Make sure that you stay up to date with the yellow labels, indicating the model's status in the making FAIR process_
        - not sure how to handle this since you need triage perms to mess with labels
        
        ## Status
        - [x] Not yet started
        - [ ] Looking for collaborators
